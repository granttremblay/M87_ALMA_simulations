#### Simulations for Aurora's Cycle 2 ALMA proposal
#### on the M87 filaments
#### G. Tremblay 22 November 2012
#######################################################

First, some preliminary thoughts: 

Philippe pointed the IRAM 30m at  the core for five hours and got only
an upper limit at both  CO(2-1) and (1-0).  He also got non-detections
in his  off-nuclear filament pointings (Salome&Comes08).   If there is
cold  gas in  M87, there  clearly  isn't very  much (less  than a  few
million Msol  at best),  so we need  to go  DEEP. The TAC  has already
approved  an ALMA core  observation of  M87 (Cycle  1 project  with PI
Vlahakis).   The quasi-duplication combined  with the  incredibly iffy
cold gas  content of this source  requires a proposal  that is unique,
compelling,  and not representative  of a  serious time  investment or
high risk for ALMA.   The Cycle 0 & 1 TACs have  so far been averse to
high risk  / high reward proposals,  particularly when they  ask for a
lot of  time. We'll  also almost certainly  need/want a mosaic  of the
filaments  (thereby increasing  our time  request), so  we need  to be
careful and realistic in our simulations.


################ 1. Make a sky model ##################

We take Aurora's  residual Ha+[NII] HST WFPC2 image,  and assume that,
if present, half  of the cold gas will  follow the extended filaments,
and half will be  contained in a region <<<1 arcsec in  the core (in a
pc-scale disk, for example). Of course, maybe all the cold gas is deep
in the core. But then there's no point to these simulations, is there?
So we have  to assume some cold gas is in  the kpc-scale filaments for
this to be a useful exercise.

We will NOT  have the dynamic range to decouple  any emission from the
mm-continuum associated  with the jet  (the spectral dynamic  range in
ALMA cycle 1 is 500, we're easily >1000 in this case). So I have taken
Aurora's image, subtracted off  residual smooth galaxy light by making
an  unsharp mask  (Aurora's image  already  had a  de Vaucouleurs  fit
subtracted from  it), blanked almost all non-filament  pixels to zero,
blanked  hot pixels  to  either  zero or  the  local filament  surface
brightness (if  cospatial with filament), ***masked out  both the core
and the jet***, and smoothed the image with a sigma=2.0 gaussian.

Note that our  sky model indeed does not include any  noise on the sky
(all non-filament pixels are exactly zero). This is intentional, as we
will  be adding  noise  in  our ALMA  simulations.  Including HST  sky
background results in an overestimation of the noise.

**There is  a critical  assumption underlying all  of this:  We assume
that the cold gas distribution  will exactly follow the Halpha surface
brightness. It is of course an inherently risky assumption (especially
as some  of the  filaments are clearly  non-stellar), but we  can't do
much better. If  all of the cold  gas is at <<<<1 arcsec  in the core,
it's pointless anyway,  so we must assume that it's  extended - and if
it is, its  likely extended along the optical filaments  (as it is for
perseus, Salome+11).   Note that there is also  [NII] contamination in
Aurora's image (but this isn't something to worry about).



###### 2. Distribute CO flux throughout our Model's filaments #######

Now let's see how much flux we can distribute along the filaments of our sky model

We'll start with Philippe's 1 sigma upper limit beam temps from his non-detection
(Salome & Combes 08). 

He lists his beam temps in mK, so we need to convert this to a proper flux: 

############################## In IDL #################################### 
tB = 2.5       ; Play with this value. First assume Philippe's upper limit
a = 13.0 / 2.0 ; IRAM CO(2-1) beam semi-major axis
b = 13.0 / 2.0 ; ... and its semi-minor axis
; constants: 
c = 2.99792458e10; 
pi = 3.1416; 
kB = 1.380658e-16; 
nu = 230.0e9 ; CO(2-1) at z=0.0821 (A2597)
Jycgs = 1.0e-23; 
arcsec2rad = 1.0 / ((180/pi)*3600.0); 

S = (tB * pi * a * b * arcsec2rad^2 * 2 * kB * nu^2 / (c^2 * ALOG(2.0) * JYcgs))
print, S; 
print, 'in mJy'
############################################################################
 
The filaments reside within a circle of area ~5800 arcsec^2. The filling factor 
is probably about 20%, so the filaments occupy ~1000 arcsec^2 (oof). 


Once we have a total integrated CO flux that we want to distribute along the 
filaments (exactly following their surface brightness profile). 


############################## In IDL #################################### 
f=readfits("m87_rescale_this.fits",hdr) ; "rescale_this.fits" is our base sky model
print, total(f,/nan)
print, max(f,/nan)			

desired_CO21_integrated_brightness = 50  ; ** must be in mJy **
                                         ; this is the *total* (integrated) flux you want to 
                                         ; distribute in the filaments.  
 
;in mJy, to distribute throughout the filaments
rescale_factor= desired_CO21_integrated_brightness / total(double(f),/nan)
print, rescale_factor
f2=(double(f)*double(rescale_factor))
print, max(f2)				; Check if this matches the total flux you wanted

; BUT WAIT! Simobserve requires the input image to be IN JY/PIXEL. NOT mJy/pixel! 

f2=(double(f2)/1000.0)
print, total(f2) ; ensure that the total flux matches the desired one IN JANSKY
writefits,"m87_alma_sim_input.fits",f2,hdr ; make our simulation input image

########################## 3.Run simulations ##############################

How to run: 
I have made a simple script here: m87_alma_sim_v1.py

Parameters to play with are well-commented and should be pretty self evident
(otherwise the CASA guides will help) 

How to run: 

1. Put the desired flux into the filament model (see above)
2. Decide on your pointings by creating (or editing) a .ptg file. List your newly 
created .ptg file in the ptgfile parameter in m87_alma_sim_v1.py
3. Tweak other parameters as desired (e.g. total time on source, etc.)
4. Run the script. Here's how:  
############################## In CASA 4.2 #################################### 
execfile("m87_alma_sim_v1.py")      
###############################################################################

Note that you MUST have 4.2 for this. If you have CASA 4.1, you need to provide
the ALMA cycle 2 antenna configuration files yourself. 


################### 4. Results from the Simulations I ran #####################

I ran the simulations under four assumptions: 



################### RUN 1: MOST OPTIMISTIC FLUX WITH FULL MOSAIC (FAIL) #####################

Run 1.  The most optimistic (and unrealistic) scenario: We assume
that the Tan+08 "detection" of CO(2-1) at 20 mJy and 30 mJy in two components
around the systemic velocity is real. In this case we distribute 50 mJy throughout 
the filaments, following the surface brightness. We assume that the TAC will 
give us infinite time, so we use 10 hours on source and mosaic the entire 
filament system. 

Params: 
Full mosaic of all filaments (7 pointings). Note that the mosaic intentionally avoids the jet. 
50 mJy spread throughout filaments
10 hours on source (evenly divided among pointings)
1 arcsec resolution at CO(2-1)

Run 1 result: Well, we detect most of the filaments, but  10 hours on source 
(results in 1.4 hours per pointing) is a really big time request for a single object. 

Conclusion: **UNLESS WE'RE ESPECIALLY BRILLIANT, I DOUBT THE TAC WILL APPROVE 
10 HOURS ON SOURCE FOR M87. WITH OVERHEADS AND CALIBRATORS THAT'S A HUGE TIME REQUEST**


############### RUN 2: MOST OPTIMISTIC FLUX WITH PARTIAL MOSAIC AND LESS TIME  ################

Run 2. Well, okay, so we clearly can't observe the whole filament system. Lets mosaic only 
the brightest part of it (i.e. the eastern "hook" feature), assuming the same (overly optimistic)
flux from Run 1. But lets reduce the time request to something reasonable (4 hours total on source).  

Params: 
Partial (3 pointing) mosaic of the SE filament "hook" feature
50 mJy flux spread throughout the entire filament system (not just the hook)
4 hours on source (evenly divided among pointings)
1 arcsec resolution at CO(2-1)

Run 2 result: We clearly pick up the SE loop in our three pointing mosaic (4 hours 
on source total) at high SN. 

Conclusion: Feasible. But remember, this assumes the most optimistic flux. 


############### RUN 3: LEAST OPTIMISTIC FLUX WITH PARTIAL MOSAIC OF SE FILAMENT  ################

Run 3. Lets see how bad we can make the flux, yet still achieve a mosaic of the SE filament 
in a reasonable time request. 


Params: 
Partial (3 pointing) mosaic of the SE filament "hook" feature
5 mJy flux spread throughout the entire filament system (not just the hook)
4 hours on source (evenly divided among pointings)
1 arcsec resolution at CO(2-1)

We've decreased the total CO flux in the filaments by a factor of 10. Will we still detect the SE loop?

Run 3 result: we barely pick it up, but not at very high SN. But it IS there and we could 
reach SN=10 with binning (I think). 


############### RUN 4: LEAST OPTIMISTIC FLUX WITH A SINGLE DEEP POITNING OF SE FILAMENT ###########

Run 4. Let's keep the flux really bad (5 mJy in the filaments total), but stare (with one pointing)
at the center of the SE filament hook for 6 hours. What is the FOV of our half power beam? What kind 
of SN do we get? Do we want to abandon a mosaic for a single deep pointing? 

Params: 
Partial (3 pointing) mosaic of the SE filament "hook" feature
5 mJy flux spread throughout the entire filament system (not just the hook)
6 hours on source (evenly divided among pointings)
1 arcsec resolution at CO(2-1)


Run 4 result: We easily pick up the brightest part of the loop, but don't resolve the 
more extended and fainter filaments to the E and NW. But we basically pick up all 
of the brightest part. Check out m87_sim_run4_result.fits to see what I mean. Remember, 
this is with the LEAST optimistic flux. 



############### RUN 5: COMPROMISE: MODERATE FLUX WITH A SMALL MOSAIC ###########

Run 5. Lets pretend that our actual flux is better than the least optimistic 
scenario, but lower than Philippe's upper limit. Say 10 mJy total throughout all 
filaments. Let's do a small mosaic of the brightest regions. 

Params. 
Partial (5 pointing) mosaic of the E and N filament regions (not the whole thing). 
10 mJy flux spread throughout the filaments. 
4 hours total. 
1 arcsec resolution at CO(2-1)

Run 5 result: Fail (mostly). We BARELY detect the northern filaments. We only detect 
the SE loop. Let's hope that this 10 mJy is really conservative. But we either 
go really deep on the northern filaments, or we don't go for them at all. 




############### PARTING THOUGHTS  ###########

Maybe we should stick to that SE loop. There might be interesting 
dynamical things going on (cold molecular and warm ionized gas pushed aside by the 
radio source?). I know the filament wraps around the lobe. 
Do we expect cold molecular gas here at all? As I recall this filament 
has no associated UV stellar continuum (check this). 

Lets do a final run with a simple TWO pointing mosaic of the SE filament, 
assuming 10 mJy total throughout all filaments (well below Philippe's upper limit) 
and using 5 hours on source (2.5 hours per pointing). 

So for Run 6 we have: 
Partial (2 pointing) mosaic of the SE filament "hook" feature
10 mJy flux spread throughout the entire filament system (not just the hook)
5 hours on source (evenly divided among pointings)
1 arcsec resolution at CO(2-1)

We get pretty good signal even in this gloomy flux scenario. (note that 
calculating exact SN is tricky as this obviously depends on how many 
channels you bin up. Right now I'm aiming for somehting like 40 km/sec
spectral resolution with this setup). Estimating how much continuum 
we expect (if any) is really tricky. There is bright 230 GHz continuum detection 
in this source, but it's completely dominated by the jet.
