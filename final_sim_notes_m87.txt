########################## 3.Run simulations ##############################

How to run: 
I have made a simple script here: m87_alma_sim_v1.py

Parameters to play with are well-commented and should be pretty self evident
(otherwise the CASA guides will help) 

How to run: 

1. Put the desired flux into the filament model (see above)
2. Decide on your pointings by creating (or editing) a .ptg file. List your newly 
created .ptg file in the ptgfile parameter in m87_alma_sim_v1.py
3. Tweak other parameters as desired (e.g. total time on source, etc.)
4. Run the script. Here's how:  
############################## In CASA 4.2 #################################### 
execfile("m87_alma_sim_v1.py")      
###############################################################################

Note that you MUST have 4.2 for this. If you have CASA 4.1, you need to provide
the ALMA cycle 2 antenna configuration files yourself. 


################### 4. Results from the Simulations I ran #####################

I ran the simulations under four assumptions: 



################### RUN 1: MOST OPTIMISTIC FLUX WITH FULL MOSAIC (FAIL) #####################

Run 1.  The most optimistic (and unrealistic) scenario: We assume
that the Tan+08 "detection" of CO(2-1) at 20 mJy and 30 mJy in two components
around the systemic velocity is real. In this case we distribute 50 mJy throughout 
the filaments, following the surface brightness. We assume that the TAC will 
give us infinite time, so we use 10 hours on source and mosaic the entire 
filament system. 

Params: 
Full mosaic of all filaments (7 pointings). Note that the mosaic intentionally avoids the jet. 
50 mJy spread throughout filaments
10 hours on source (evenly divided among pointings)
1 arcsec resolution at CO(2-1)

Run 1 result: Well, we detect most of the filaments, but  10 hours on source 
(results in 1.4 hours per pointing) is a really big time request for a single object. 

Conclusion: **UNLESS WE'RE ESPECIALLY BRILLIANT, I DOUBT THE TAC WILL APPROVE 
10 HOURS ON SOURCE FOR M87. WITH OVERHEADS AND CALIBRATORS THAT'S A HUGE TIME REQUEST**


############### RUN 2: MOST OPTIMISTIC FLUX WITH PARTIAL MOSAIC AND LESS TIME  ################

Run 2. Well, okay, so we clearly can't observe the whole filament system. Lets mosaic only 
the brightest part of it (i.e. the eastern "hook" feature), assuming the same (overly optimistic)
flux from Run 1. But lets reduce the time request to something reasonable (4 hours total on source).  

Params: 
Partial (3 pointing) mosaic of the SE filament "hook" feature
50 mJy flux spread throughout the entire filament system (not just the hook)
4 hours on source (evenly divided among pointings)
1 arcsec resolution at CO(2-1)

Run 2 result: We clearly pick up the SE loop in our three pointing mosaic (4 hours 
on source total) at high SN. 

Conclusion: Feasible. But remember, this assumes the most optimistic flux. 


############### RUN 3: LEAST OPTIMISTIC FLUX WITH PARTIAL MOSAIC OF SE FILAMENT  ################

Run 3. Lets see how bad we can make the flux, yet still achieve a mosaic of the SE filament 
in a reasonable time request. 


Params: 
Partial (3 pointing) mosaic of the SE filament "hook" feature
5 mJy flux spread throughout the entire filament system (not just the hook)
4 hours on source (evenly divided among pointings)
1 arcsec resolution at CO(2-1)

We've decreased the total CO flux in the filaments by a factor of 10. Will we still detect the SE loop?

Run 3 result: we barely pick it up, but not at very high SN. But it IS there and we could 
reach SN=10 with binning (I think). 


############### RUN 4: LEAST OPTIMISTIC FLUX WITH A SINGLE DEEP POITNING OF SE FILAMENT ###########

Run 4. Let's keep the flux really bad (5 mJy in the filaments total), but stare (with one pointing)
at the center of the SE filament hook for 6 hours. What is the FOV of our half power beam? What kind 
of SN do we get? Do we want to abandon a mosaic for a single deep pointing? 

Params: 
Partial (3 pointing) mosaic of the SE filament "hook" feature
5 mJy flux spread throughout the entire filament system (not just the hook)
6 hours on source (evenly divided among pointings)
1 arcsec resolution at CO(2-1)


Run 4 result: We easily pick up the brightest part of the loop, but don't resolve the 
more extended and fainter filaments to the E and NW. But we basically pick up all 
of the brightest part. Check out m87_sim_run4_result.fits to see what I mean. Remember, 
this is with the LEAST optimistic flux. 



############### RUN 5: COMPROMISE: MODERATE FLUX WITH A SMALL MOSAIC ###########

Run 5. Lets pretend that our actual flux is better than the least optimistic 
scenario, but lower than Philippe's upper limit. Say 10 mJy total throughout all 
filaments. Let's do a small mosaic of the brightest regions. 

Params. 
Partial (5 pointing) mosaic of the E and N filament regions (not the whole thing). 
10 mJy flux spread throughout the filaments. 
4 hours total. 
1 arcsec resolution at CO(2-1)

Run 5 result: Fail (mostly). We BARELY detect the northern filaments. We only detect 
the SE loop. Let's hope that this 10 mJy is really conservative. But we either 
go really deep on the northern filaments, or we don't go for them at all. 




############### PARTING THOUGHTS  ###########

Maybe we should stick to that SE loop. There might be interesting 
dynamical things going on (cold molecular and warm ionized gas pushed aside by the 
radio source?). I know the filament wraps around the lobe. 
Do we expect cold molecular gas here at all? As I recall this filament 
has no associated UV stellar continuum (check this). 

Lets do a final run with a simple TWO pointing mosaic of the SE filament, 
assuming 10 mJy total throughout all filaments (well below Philippe's upper limit) 
and using 5 hours on source (2.5 hours per pointing). 

So for Run 6 we have: 
Partial (2 pointing) mosaic of the SE filament "hook" feature
10 mJy flux spread throughout the entire filament system (not just the hook)
5 hours on source (evenly divided among pointings)
1 arcsec resolution at CO(2-1)

We get pretty good signal even in this gloomy flux scenario. (note that 
calculating exact SN is tricky as this obviously depends on how many 
channels you bin up. Right now I'm aiming for somehting like 40 km/sec
spectral resolution with this setup). Estimating how much continuum 
we expect (if any) is really tricky. There is bright 230 GHz continuum detection 
in this source, but it's completely dominated by the jet.
